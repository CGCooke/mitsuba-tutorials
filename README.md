# Mitsuba 2 Tutorials

> :warning: **WARNING**: These tutorials are designed for an as-of-yet unreleased version of the Mitsuba 2 codebase. They will *not* work with the current version of the renderer.

This repository contains Mitsuba 2 tutorials in the form of interactive Jupyter
notebooks. Amongst other things, they explain how to

- invoke the renderer from Python.
- programmatically construct scenes.
- account for polarization effects in simulations.
- conduct differentiable and inverse rendering.
